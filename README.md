In the project directory, users can play a game of solitaire with custom playing cards featuring iconic black women in leadership from the Heiritage LLC.

I co-founded and established Heiritage, LLC- a family friendly, toy and gaming company in January 2018 to celebrate self love of the African American Culture and Heritage. The Heiritage playing cards (1st edition) comprise 52 deck of cards featuring custom renditions 15 of our favorite super women who have fostered courage strength, and fortitude to break barriers and make significant contribution to American history. Some of the women featured in the deck are Michelle Obama, Rosa Parks, Harriett Tubman, Madam C. J. Walker, Nina Simone among others.

I wanted to create a solitaire app to combine my two passions: (1) Coding + (2)Entrepreneurship!
